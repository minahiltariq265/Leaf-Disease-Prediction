# Leaf Disease Prediction using ResNet50
This project focuses on predicting different types of leaf diseases using deep learning techniques. 
# Labels
- Healthy: 0
- Common Rust: 1
- Blight: 2
- Gray Leaf Spot: 3
# Dataset
The dataset consists of images of maize leaves and their corresponding labels. The images are processed and augmented using TensorFlow's `ImageDataGenerator`. 
# Output
The model achieves an accuracy of X% and F2 score of Y%. The predcted labels are generated in the form of submission.csv.
